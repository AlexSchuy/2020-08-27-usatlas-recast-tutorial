## Preservation
The next few sections contain information on how to preserve a new analysis. Note that a lot of new material is covered in these sections; if you don't get through it all, that's okay! You can always refer to it later as you work on an analysis. Also, each section has a directory on git that contains the files needed for that section; if you can't get your code from a section to work, you can use these files for comparison.
