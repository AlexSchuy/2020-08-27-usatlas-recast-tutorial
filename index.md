Welcome to the US ATLAS computing bootcamp's 2020 tutorial on ATLAS analysis preservation and reinterpretation with RECAST! Now that you've seen how docker can reproducibly provide the exact computing environment you want and start up customized applications at a moment's notice, we're going to look at an application of docker being used in ATLAS called RECAST. We'll start with reinterpretations of existing analyses using recast-atlas and recast-cli, and then at the end we'll see how you can use docker and gitlab to preserve your own ATLAS analysis.
